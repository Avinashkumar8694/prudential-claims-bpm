# jBPM Engine (Node.js) — Documentation

A **fully-featured, Node.js-native BPM engine with a visual workflow builder UI**, built on top of
[`@neutrinos/bpmn-sdk`](../../bpmn-sdk). It authors processes in the SDK's clean *engine (nodejs)*
JSON model, executes them in a Node token-based interpreter, manages **deployments with branching +
per-branch versioning + deployment tags**, exposes **per-instance execution details with the live
executing flow**, and can **export any workflow as a deployable jBPM (Business Central) kjar**.

> This `docs/` folder is written **before** implementation and gates it. Read it in order; the
> [checklist](./10-checklist.md) and [roadmap](./11-roadmap.md) drive the build.

## Vision

Give business users the jBPM/Business Central authoring & operations experience — palette, canvas,
properties panel, deployments, running instances, execution audit — but running entirely on Node.js,
with zero Java/KIE server required, and a one-click escape hatch to export to real jBPM when needed.

## Tech stack (decided)

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Backend | **Node 20 + TypeScript + Express** | Small, ubiquitous, matches SDK toolchain |
| Authoring model | **`@neutrinos/bpmn-sdk` engine JSON** | Already the project's source of truth; converts to/from BPMN |
| Execution | **Custom Node token interpreter** | Runs in Node; reuses SDK rule/DMN/tree/scorecard evaluators |
| Persistence | **File store now, Postgres later** (repository interface) | Zero-setup dev; swappable in prod |
| Realtime | **WebSocket (ws)** | Live instance/flow updates to the UI |
| Frontend | **Angular 18 (standalone) + TypeScript** | Requested; enterprise-grade, batteries-included |
| Canvas | **@foblex/flow** (Angular flow/diagram lib) | Purpose-built node/edge editor matching the reference UI; fallback: custom SVG + Angular CDK drag-drop |
| UI state | **Angular signals + injectable stores** (NgRx optional) | Native, minimal ceremony |
| UI kit | **Angular CDK** (overlay, drag-drop, a11y) + hand-rolled components | Matches the exact reference look without a heavy theme |
| Export | **SDK `fromEngineProject` + `writeProject`** | One-click kjar export |

## Repository layout

```
jbpm-engine/
  docs/            ← you are here
  server/          ← backend (Express API + execution engine + stores)
  app/             ← frontend (Angular workflow builder + operations console)
  package.json     ← npm workspaces root (server, app)
```

## Quick start (once implemented)

```bash
cd jbpm-engine
npm install                 # installs server + app workspaces
npm run dev                 # server on :4000, app (Angular) on :4200
```
