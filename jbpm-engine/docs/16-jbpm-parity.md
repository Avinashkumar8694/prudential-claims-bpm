# 16 — jBPM Feature Parity & Capability Report

How this Node engine compares to jBPM / Business Central, per feature area, with the evidence that
proves each claim. **Legend:** ✅ full · 🟡 partial · ⛔ not yet · ➖ Node-native (intentionally different).

**Verification base:** `server` unit suite **28/28** (`npm test`) + a live end-to-end **12/12**
(`node server/e2e/parity.mjs` against a running server). Re-run both to reproduce.

## A. Authoring / Designer

## Not yet (tracked in the checklist)
- Embedded/transaction **sub-process execution**; **boundary-timer & start-timer (cron)** firing.
- **Decision-tree & scorecard** runtime; richer **DRL**.
- **Work-item nodes** (Email/DB/Compute/SMS) via a handler framework.
- **Auth/RBAC enforcement**, multi-tenant admin, **secrets encryption**, **Postgres** store.
- **Asset editors**, **task inbox UI**, **live canvas highlight**, **kjar import** endpoint, **automated UI e2e** (Playwright).

## How to reproduce
```bash
cd jbpm-engine/server && npm test            # 28/28 unit
# with the server running on :4000:
node e2e/parity.mjs                          # 12/12 live feature scenarios
```
UI: `npm run dev:app` → the builder/deployments/instances views exercise the same APIs verified above.
