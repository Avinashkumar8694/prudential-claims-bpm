// Boundary/error-catch matching logic — previously implemented as private ExecutionEngine methods
// (a real self-containment violation: every other node type's logic lives in its own folder, but
// 'boundary' had none at all beyond def.ts's UI config). Pure, stateless functions only: deciding
// WHICH node matches a given host/error/timer situation. The actual state mutation that ACTS on that
// decision (pushing tokens, cancelling timers, running compensations) stays in execution-engine.ts's
// raiseError/fireBoundary/fireTimerJob, since those need engine capabilities (this.ctx, this.
// removeToken, this.runToQuiescence, the timer repo) a plain function can't get without a much larger
// context-threading exercise — fireTimerJob in particular is called externally from
// modules/instances/service.ts's timer-poll path, so it can't become a free function at all.
//
// Note this file's logic isn't PURELY about 'boundary' nodes: isErrorCatch/catchErrorName/
// isGlobalCatch also recognize an event sub-process with an error start (n.type === 'subprocess',
// on.error set) as an error-catch — jBPM's other common "global error handler" idiom. This is the
// natural home for that matching logic regardless (boundary is the dominant case), but it's "error-
// catch-capable node matching," not boundary-exclusive.

// jBPM/BPMN error declarations are named for human/XML readability (e.g. "REST_API_FAILURE" with
// errorCode "org.jbpm.bpmn2.handler.WorkItemHandlerRuntimeException"); the Node runtime only ever
// raises one of the fixed ENGINE_ERRORS codes, since that's determined entirely by which node TYPE
// failed (an http node can only ever produce SERVICE_ERROR, a script node only SCRIPT_ERROR, etc).
// A catch attached to one specific host can therefore only ever see one possible code anyway, so it
// matches on ANY error from that host regardless of what name the author (or the mechanical jBPM
// conversion) gave it — no author or converted process needs to know this runtime's internal
// vocabulary. A GLOBAL catch (on: '*', or any event sub-process error-start, which is always
// process-wide) still needs the code to disambiguate if there's more than one global handler; a
// declared name that isn't itself one of ENGINE_ERRORS defaults to SERVICE_ERROR, since "catch
// failures anywhere" overwhelmingly means "catch service/work-item failures" in real jBPM projects
// (this project's own pru-sample-global-error/pru-api-error-handler are exactly that pattern). Use
// an explicit ENGINE_ERRORS name, or '*'/'ANY'/empty, to mean something else or to catch everything.

 *  execution failure (i.e. IS one of ENGINE_ERRORS — never true for an author's own error-throw
